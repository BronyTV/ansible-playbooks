This is the Ansible Playbook for the BronyTV website. It will ensure that nginx and php are properly installed and configured, and that the site is deployed properly to the server.

This is intended to be ran on a server whose nginx install hosts nothing but the BronyTV website.

This operates on servers in the `bronytv-web` group.

Ansible Playbooks for various BronyTV-related things.

These probably aren't very useful to anybody but us, and are more provided as a transparency thing than anything else.

Currently, there exists only the playbook which deploys our website. This uses the `web` and `unattended-upgrades` roles, and operates on the `bronytv-web` host group.
